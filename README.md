# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week we were tasked to build an API that includes GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data

## The problem

There weren't any big problems this week, the lectures covered basically everything we needed to know and we just had to tweak it a bit to make it work for our project. I think the biggest problem/concern is to deploy it correctly.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
